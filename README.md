## Problem 1: Pseudo Challenge

Below are list of pseudocode descriptions of the algorithms from [Russell](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [Norvig's](http://www.norvig.com/) [Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/).

- Pick any pseudocode and implement in your favourite programming language!
- Reflect your thoughts in no more than two (2) pages
